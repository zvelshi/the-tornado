## üå™Ô∏è The Tornado - Low Strain Beverage Stirrer

As a part of our Engineering design and problem solving course, ENGINEER 1P13, we were tasked to role play as an engineering design team that focuses
on a real-world issue that a client in the community faces. Our team was required to come up with a solution that makes the client‚Äôs daily living better. To do this, we had to accomplish the following steps:
1. Frame a design problem in terms of the needs of the client, objectives, constraints, functions, and metrics.
2. Follow an iterative design process of ideas generation, prototyping and testing.
3. Communicate your design quickly and effectively to non-team members and use feedback for validation of your design and/or to seek new ideas to refine your design.
4. Finalize your design and write a professional engineering report describing the process and outcome of your design project to a client.

Employing the Engineering Design Process, we framed the problem, generated ideas, and crafted an innovative solution. Through iterative cycles of prototyping and testing, we honed our design while effectively communicating with stakeholders. The culmination was a sleek stirring and heating device, alleviating repetitive wrist strain. Our process, involving constraints and a PID algorithm, exemplified our commitment to functional, client-focused design. A comprehensive engineering report documented our journey, reflecting our dedication to delivering impactful solutions."
